# Covid Vaccine Trcaker

Problem Statement:

Covid vaccine is one of the crucial tools to fight against covid-19. Many countries are working at their full strength to vaccinate their citizens.
It becomes important to track who has taken the vaccine and who hasnâ€™t. Since most vaccines come in two shots, it has become equally important to track who got first short and who got both the shots. It has become difficult to track down fake covid vaccine recipients. 

Solution:

An immutable solution is needed where covid vaccine recipients can be tracked and updated as and when they receive the first or second shot.

Features of Covid Vaccine Application:
* Adds first dose recipients of the vaccine
* View covid vaccination status
* Update the status of the recipient after the second dose

Tools Used:

1. Smart Contract development: Solidity
2. IDE tool: Remix
3. Blockchain: Ethereum
4. Server: Ganache Blockchain
